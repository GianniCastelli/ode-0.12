This is my personal clone of ODE 0.12, with some sample projects.

Specifically, this branch includes a "re-boot" of the "raycar" arcade 
racing car demo I wrote many years ago. This time, I'm using OpenGL 
instead of D3D, so the project can perhaps be portable at some point. 
Also, it's using the latest version of ODE as of this writing, which 
should ease compiling for those brave enough to try.

To be clear: The car physics in this project (mostly contained in 
car.cpp) is not yet as slick as that in the original raycar; however, 
if I can find the wherewithal to keep working on it, it can very well 
turn out to be a good replacement for that demo, and I might even port 
it to Linux at some point (VMWare willing.)
